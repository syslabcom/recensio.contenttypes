<p><span class="logo-text">Rezensionsplattform für die europäische Geschichtswissenschaft</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>recensio.net will create a Europe-wide, multi-language platform for reviews of historical literature. recensio.net is a joint project of the Bavarian State Library (BSB) Munich, the German Historical Institute Paris (DHIP) and the Institute for European History (IEG) Mainz – funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG).</p>
<p>recensio.net is committed to the principles of Open Access. All content will be permanently accessible free of charge. The reviews and publications on the platform focus on work published in Europe and featuring European topics. The platform’s navigational languages are English, German and French, while the reviews may be written in any European language.</p>
<p>The platform is based on two main ideas:</p>
<h2><i>recensio.net brings together »classical« reviews</i></h2>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p class="Pa0">Editorial offices of journals or institutes who have only published in print so far will be able to prominently publish their review sections online – be it exclusively online or in a »hybrid« form as either a pre- or post-print. In doing so, it is irrelevant whether the reviews are already accessible online. recensio.net makes no claim to the exclusivity of its contents but wants to offer editorial staff a maximum degree of visibility and users a central starting point in their search for reviews of scholarly literature by bringing together scattered and often scarcely visible reviews.</p>
<p>The co-operating editorial staffs will continue working independently. The review sections of the different journals will remain separate and enable targeted access. »Classical« reviews are usually published as pdf-files so that the usual visual appearance of every journal remains intact, too. Apart from that, every published review will be detectable separately: by means of the <a class="internal-link" href="browse-topics">content browsing</a> or the cross-platform <a class="internal-link" href="search">search</a>.</p>
<h2><i>recensio.net en route to web 2.0</i></h2>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>Authors are able to present the core statements of their publications (monographs or articles) on recensio.net. Gradually, moderated user comments will create »live reviews« based on these presentations. Academic online resources can also be presented and reviewed here to allow for the continuous development of the resources.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we want to allow for the changing review patterns in the academic sector. Reviewers often lack the time to write an entire review of a text in its entirety. With a comment they get the chance to give their opinion quickly and easily on an aspect of the text, which at the same time facilitates reviews across various disciplines: A sociologist can review a chapter of an historical publication in reference to his own field without any difficulties.</p>
<p>On the other hand, recensio.net wants to do justice to the central position of articles published in journals or edited volumes in academic writing by giving the possibility to present them, too. So far, articles have only attracted attention within reviews of edited volumes, in which the individual articles have often been neglected. Here, recensio.net wants to offer an up-to-date alternative.</p>
<h2><i>recensio.net offers</i></h2>
<p><i> </i></p>
<ul>
<li>- a highly increased prominence for reviews by providing a comprehensive platform search facility and connection to the OPAC;</li>
<li>- a faster publication process, bringing the review closer to the publication date of the reviewed text; thus</li>
<li>- a modern adaptation to changing reading behaviours differing greatly between reviews and articles.</li>
</ul>
