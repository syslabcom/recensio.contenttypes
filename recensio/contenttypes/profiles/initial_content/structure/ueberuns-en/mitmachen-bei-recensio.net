<p><i>recensio.net</i> brings together »classic« review sections from editorial staffs of European historical journals working independently. Besides this, the platform has launched a new form of academic reviewing, based on web 2.0 (<a href="konzept">concept</a>). recensio.net particularly aims to engage different types of users with the platform. We are looking forward to getting in touch with you:</p>
<h4 class="hide_title">… with you as editorial staff or an academic institution:</h4>
<p class="hide_content">Journals with scholarly editorial teams and/or attached to research institutions and who publish reviews on European history are very welcome to also publish their reviews on recensio.net. After a prompt evaluation by the institutions and editors involved in recensio.net, we would be happy to integrate you into the platform as a co-operation partner. Your reviews will have greater visibility and can be found more easily by making the files searchable in full-text and linking them to the BVB-catalogue. They can be published on recensio.net as a pre- or post-print in addition to the print version (»hybrid«). It is also possible to completely outsource the review section of a journal to recensio.net (»exclusively electronic publication«) Since we work with a highly automated CMS the editorial staff does not have to invest much time on this co-operation. Our service is free of charge. Together with you we will develop a concept of co-operating on a continual basis which will also guarantee long-term archival storage by the Bavarian State Library.</p>
<h4 class="hide_title">… with you as an author:</h4>
<p class="hide_content">You are invited to present the core statements of your already published works on recensio.net. User comments will then create a new form of review (»live review«) based on these presentations. To facilitate this in-depth discussion you will be asked in our presentation form to name scholarly authors with whose works you have dealt in your own text. recensio.net will usually try to inform them of your publication, its presentation on the platform and the possibility to comment on it. You have the chance to present not only monographs on recensio.net but also articles (taken from journals or edited volumes). You will automatically be informed of incoming comments; additionally, these will be examined by the editorial staff to prevent malpractice. Refer to our concept and user guidelines on this.</p>
<h4 class="hide_title">… with you as a user:</h4>
<p class="hide_content">Share your ideas and suggestions with us; specific information on which European scholarly journals with a review section may be interested in recensio.net would also be welcome. In this way, the editorial staff and the users will likewise be able to benefit from recensio.net.</p>
