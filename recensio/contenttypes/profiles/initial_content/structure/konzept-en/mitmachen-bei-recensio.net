<p><i>recensio.net</i> brings together »classic« review sections from editorial staffs of European historical journals working independently. Besides this, the platform has launched a new form of academic reviewing, based on web 2.0 (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">concept</span>).</p>
<p><i>recensio.net</i> particularly aims to engage different types of users with the platform. We are looking forward to getting in touch with you:</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<h4 class="hide_title">… with you as editorial staff or an academic institution:</h4>
<p class="hide_content">Journals with scholarly editorial teams and/or attached to research institutions and who publish reviews on European history are very welcome to also publish their reviews on <i>recensio.net</i>.</p>
<p class="hide_content">After a prompt evaluation by the institutions and editors involved in <i>recensio.net</i>, we would be happy to integrate you into the platform as a co-operation partner.</p>
<p class="hide_content">Your reviews will have greater visibility and can be found more easily by making the files searchable in full-text and linking them to the BVB-catalogue.</p>
<p class="hide_content">They can be published on <i>recensio.net</i> as a pre- or post-print in addition to the print version (»hybrid«). It is also possible to completely outsource the review section of a journal to <i>recensio.net</i> (»exclusively electronic publication«)</p>
<p class="hide_content">Since we work with a highly automated CMS the editorial staff does not have to invest much time on this co-operation. Our service is free of charge.</p>
<p class="hide_content">Together with you we will develop a concept of co-operating on a continual basis which will also guarantee long-term archival storage by the Bavarian State Library.</p>
<h4 class="hide_title">… with you as an author:</h4>
<p class="hide_content">You are invited to present the core statements of your already published works on <i>recensio.net</i>. User comments will then create a new form of review (»live review«) based on these presentations. To facilitate this in-depth discussion you will be asked in our presentation form to name scholarly authors with whose works you have dealt in your own text. <i>recensio.net</i> will usually try to inform them of your publication, its presentation on the platform and the possibility to comment on it.</p>
<p class="hide_content">You have the chance to present not only monographs on <i>recensio.net</i> but also articles (taken from journals or edited volumes).</p>
<p class="hide_content">You will automatically be informed of incoming comments; additionally, these will be examined by the editorial staff to prevent malpractice. Refer to our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">concept</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">user guidelines</span> on this.</p>

<p class="hide_content">Share your ideas and suggestions with us; specific information on which European scholarly journals with a review section may be interested in <i>recensio.net</i> would also be welcome.</p>
